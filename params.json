  "body": "Our task:\r\n\r\nOur goal was to explore the relationship between a student's GPA and the activities in which the student takes part.\r\nOur tools:\r\n\r\nWe used Linear regression to try to predict a student's GPA. We also used Logit functions to try to predict the best students, and several machine learning techniques to attempt to classify students as \"at-risk.\"\r\nOur data:\r\n\r\nWe used data collected from a student survey given to students at a suburban Indiana High School. Students were asked to rate themselves on many different factors. Some of these included study time, participation in sports/clubs/music, working hours, and reading/gaming hours.\r\nAuthors and Contributors\r\n\r\nJoseph Kintzel, Bernard Mcshea, Vishal Kapoor\r\n",
