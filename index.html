        <p>Our task:</p>

<p>Our goal was to explore the relationship between a student's GPA and the activities in which the student takes part.  </p>

<p>Our tools:</p>

<p>We used Linear regression to try to predict a student's GPA. We also used Logit functions to try to predict the best students, and several machine learning techniques to attempt to classify students as "at-risk."  </p>

<p>Our data:</p>

<p>We used data collected from a student survey given to students at a suburban Indiana High School. Students were asked to rate themselves on many different factors. Some of these included study time, participation in sports/clubs/music, working hours, and reading/gaming hours.  </p>
